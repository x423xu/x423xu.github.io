# Using Jekyll to create a gitpage on windows
## Understanding Jekyll, Gem, Bundle, Ruby
### [what is Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
>Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

Ruby is most used for **building web applications**. However, it is a general-purpose language similar to Python, so it has many other applications like data analysis, prototyping, and proof of concepts.

### [What is a Ruby gem?](https://www.rubyguides.com/2018/09/ruby-gems-gemfiles-bundler/)

A gem is a package that you can download & install. When you require an installed gem you’re adding extra functionality to your Ruby program.

### [What Is Bundler?](https://www.rubyguides.com/2018/09/ruby-gems-gemfiles-bundler/)

While learning about Ruby gems you may also read about Bundler. But what is Bundler exactly? Bundler is a tool for dependency management. Didn’t RubyGems already handle this? Well, it does… but only for the gems themselves. Your regular Ruby application isn’t built as a gem, so it doesn’t get this feature. That’s why Bundler exists!

Bundler (and RubyGems since version 2.0) can read Gemfile & install the requested versions of the gems.
 1. `gem 'rails', '~> 5.2.1'`
 2. `gem 'puma', '~> 3.11'`

## Using jekyll to create a "Hello world" post
- Install Ruby, Gem
- Using Gem to install Jekyll, Bundler, Wdm, Webrick:
  `gem install jekyll bundler wdm webrick`
- Create a directory to deposite your personal website:
  `mkdir docs, cd docs`
- Create **Gemfile** to list project's dependencies: `bundle init`
- Modify **Gemfile** by adding:
  + `gem "jekyll"`
  + `gem webrick`
  + `gem 'wdm', '>= 0.1.0' if Gem.win_platform?`
- Create your site by creating an `index.html`
- Write something:
    ```<!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Home</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </body>
    </html>

- Create local site: `jekyll serve`
